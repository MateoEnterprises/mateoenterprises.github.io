  <section class="aboutMe">
    <p>I am new to web-dev. Working on mastering the feilds of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I hope to acquire a job in the market as  a Jr. Developer. I have familiarity with JQuery, AJAX, Angular, NodeJS, DBaaS and Firebase.</p>
    <p>While I do enjoy coding and creating who knows what, I certaintly enjoy my time not in front of the screen just as much. I spend time hiking or mountain biking with my family, or just relaxing watching movies. I am a true down to earth person that likes to work hard and play hard. </p>

        <p>With my time spent here we covered the topics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Angular, DBaaS and Firebase. It was a great learning experience for myself. It set me up to figure out how I wanted to continue to teach myself outside of this program and what areas I need to work on. </p></li>

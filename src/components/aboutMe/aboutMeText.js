      <p>As someone who enjoys creating and improving things, I found front-end development a few years ago and began the process of self learning while working full time. After a short stint I put myself through a coding boot camp at DevMtn where I still worked full time so I could expedite switching careers.</p>
      <p>Having been in web-development for 2 years now, I thuroughly enjoy coding and improving websites through UI/UX updates and planning for the future. Being able to create and improve is a passion I have for work and life.</p>
      <p>Coming from a managerial postion for 3PL where I handled customers such as Boeing and Northrop Grumman I harnessed those skills for effeciency and precision to get tasks done correctly. </p>
